# NYC-Taxi-regression-analysis

## Build a multiple linear regression model
### Model metrics:
Net model tuning resulted in:
- R^2 0.81, meaning that 81.5% of the variance is described by the model.
- MAE: 2.4
- MSE: 19.1
- RMSE: 4.4

## KEY INSIGHTS
1. The feature with the greatest effect on fare amount was ride duration, which was not unexpected. The model revealed a mean increase of $9.6 for each additional minute, however, this is not a reliable benchmark due to high correlation between some features.
2. Request additional data from under-represented itineraries.
3. The New York City Taxi and Limousine commission can use these findings to create an app that allows users (TLC riders) to see the estimated fare before their ride begins.
4. The model provides a generally strong and reliable fare prediction that can be used in downstream modeling efforts.



**The purpose** of this project is to demostrate knowledge of EDA and a multiple linear regression model.

**The goal** is to build a multiple linear regression model and evaluate the model.
